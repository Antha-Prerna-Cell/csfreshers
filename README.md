### Welcome :)
Welcome to the world of tech-wizards.
<br>

### About
A guide-page for all freshers who just took Computer Science as a major.
<br>

### Learning your first language
While learning you first language, kindly give more time practicing it and understanding what happens in that black-box of 17x7x18 inch when you double click a program that you just wrote.
<br><br>
If your programming concepts are clear and you have a strong foundation in your first language, then learning a new language will just be a matter of 7 to 8 hours max.
<br>

### Learning basics
Once you feel comfortable with making your console type school management programs, then its time you learn some basics like-<br>
* Data Structures<br>
* Algorithms<br>
* Basic HTML5, CSS3<br>
* JSON, YAML<br>
* Git - the version control system<br>

### Online coding competitions
There are many good online coding competition sites for you to practice your skills. Once you get comfortable with the basics, then you would love to practice or compete with other programmers around the globe.<br><br>
Please do not be disappointed if you are not able to solve such competitive problem at the beginning. Just keep trying or ask help from someone who is already involved in solving such problems.<br><br>
When you begin, start from easier problems and then move towards more tough one as you gain confidence.<br><br>
