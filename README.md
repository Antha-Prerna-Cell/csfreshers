### Welcome :)
Welcome to the world of tech-wizards.


### About
A guide-page for all freshers who just took Computer Science as a major.


### Learning your first language
While learning you first language, kindly give more time practicing it and understanding what happens in that black-box of 17x7x18 inch when you double click a program that you just wrote.

If your programming concepts are clear and you have a strong foundation in your first language, then learning a new language will just be a matter of 7 to 8 hours max.


### Learning basics
Once you feel comfortable with making your console type school management programs, then its time you learn some basics like-<br>
* Data Structures - [Geeks-for-Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)
* Algorithms - [Geeks-for-Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
* Basic HTML5, CSS3 - [W3-School](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
* JSON, YAML
* Docker - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)
* Git - the version control system - [Git-braching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)


### Online coding competitions
There are many good online coding competition sites for you to practice your skills. Once you get comfortable with the basics, then you would love to practice or compete with other programmers around the globe.

Please do not be disappointed if you are not able to solve such competitive problem at the beginning. Just keep trying or ask help from someone who is already involved in solving such problems.

When you begin, start from easier problems and then move towards more tough one as you gain confidence.

Checkout this [io-tutorial guide by google](https://code.google.com/codejam/resources/quickstart-guide#io-tutorial)

Some Online Coding competition sites are-
* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)
* [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests)
* [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com/)
* There are many others that can be added to make this list very long. So go [here](https://github.com/anu0012/awesome-computer-science-opportunities#competitive-programming) for more.


### Technologies
Quickly google these technologies and try understand what these are-
* Machine Learning, Deep Learning
* Blockchain
* Serverless
* Augmented reality(AR) and virtual reality(VR)
* Multi-access Edge Computing(MEC)
* Quantum Computing
* SDN, NVF, VNF


### Go to Hackathons
Start going to hackathons.

Read more about hackathons [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/hackathon/).

Check [this](https://github.com/ayonroy2000/Hackathonistas_TelegramGroup/blob/master/Hackathons.md) list you may find some interesting hackathons.


### Join developer communities in your area
Usually there will be some programming communities in your area which you can join.<br>
These communities-
 1. Conducts some Meetups, Workshops, Conferences monthly which you can attend and meet new people.
 2. Usually have a group on **telegram/WhatsApp** which you can join.
 
### Meetups
Go to meetups.

You can get to know about meetups from [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/).



### Open Source Contributions
This the most beautiful part of whole developer community. Open source is the fuel that runs our world. Start contributing to open source. Ways you can contribute to a opensource projects -
1. Report a bug to the projectâ€™s issue tracker
2. Submit suggestions for features
3. Answer a question publicly as a to help new people
4. Blog and tweet about it
5. Attend or volunteer its meetup
6. Verify and document bugs
7. Write an example for the documentation
8. Contribute through Code

Read this is [blog](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/open-source_gettingstarted/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NewRelic+%28New+Relic+Blog%29) by Andy Lester for more on getting started to opensouce.

### Internships
Please do not waste your vacations. Apply for internships of your interest when their applications open.
Check this awesome [list](https://github.com/tapaswenipathak/Open-Source-Internships) of internships by Tapasweni Pathak.


### Bug Bounty Programs
In bug bounty programs you have to find bugs and you get paid for reporting bugs, especially those pertaining to exploits and vulnerabilities.


### Personal note
Read as much as you can. Don't wait for anyone to come and teach something. Just go to the web and start learning.
